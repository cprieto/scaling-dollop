# DBF is not dead!

Well, in reality is super dead! I was bored one weekend and decided to write a library to parse/write DBF files, yes those pesky files made by [DBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) and [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro) which were very popular during the 90's for simple database applications.

## What can do so far?

Well, right now only reading memo files (for DBase3, 4 and FoxPro).

## Things next

- [X] Check Visual FoxPro memo files
- [X] Check DBase 5 memo files
- [ ] Start parsing DBF!
