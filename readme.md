# DBF is not dead!

Well, in reality is super dead! I was bored one weekend and decided to write a library to parse/write DBF files, yes those pesky files made by [DBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) and [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro) which were very popular during the 90's for simple database applications.

## What can do so far?

Well, right now only reading memo files (for DBase3, 4 and FoxPro).

## Things next

- [X] Check Visual FoxPro memo files
- [X] Check DBase 5 memo files
- [ ] Start parsing DBF!

## Sources

There are a lot of places with different descriptions for DBF files:

1. [XFile Format Description](http://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/database/xbase/#INDEX) this is probably the most complete guide out there
2. [DBF File Format](https://www.dbf2002.com/dbf-file-format.html) from a DBF Viewer and editor, simple to read
3. [DBF and DBT/FPT File Structure](https://www.independent-software.com/dbase-dbf-dbt-file-format.html) is a nice one with some comments and sample code
